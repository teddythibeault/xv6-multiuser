This is a modification of the xv6 operating system with the addition of multiple users.
There is one default user root, with no password.
There is one default TTY session.

Upon successfully logging in with root, password can be set using

	passwd

passwd does not take any arguments, and sets or changes the password of the current user.

The current user is stored in the file:

	/utmp

The current user can be obtained running the command

	w

Upon logging in, new users can be added with:

	adduser [username]

You can switch users using the su command:

	su [username]
