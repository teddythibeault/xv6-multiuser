This is a modification of the xv6 operating system with the addition of multiple users, made for Boston College's
Operating Systems course in collaboration between Theodore Thibeault and Luke Ruter.

For more detailed descriptions and examples of each command execution, see report.pdf.

There is one default user root, with no password.
There is one default TTY session.

Upon successfully logging in with root, password can be set using

	passwd

passwd does not take any arguments, and sets or changes the password of the current user.

The current user is stored in the file:

	/utmp

The current user can be obtained running the command

	w

Upon logging in, new users can be added with:

	adduser [username]

You can switch users using the su command:

	su [username]
